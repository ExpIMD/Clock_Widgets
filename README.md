# Clock Widgets in Tkinter

This project contains Python implementations of three types of clocks using the Tkinter GUI toolkit:

- **Round Analog Clock** — a classic round clock with hour, minute, and second hands.
- **Pendulum Clock** — an extension of the round clock featuring a swinging pendulum below.
- **Digital Clock** — a digital clock displaying time with custom seven-segment digits.

## Notes

The animations are smooth, it is also possible to regulate using the delay parameter

The clock shows the current real world time
